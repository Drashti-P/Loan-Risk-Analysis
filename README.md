# Loan-Risk-Analysis
Forage - Quantitative Research - Loan Risk Analysis

This repository contains my solution to the third project of the Forage JPMorgan Quantitative Research Virtual Internship. This task involved predicting loan defaults for a commercial bank, using a dataset of each customer's loan profile. The code includes my exploratory data analysis to uncover interesting and hidden trends, as well as the implementation of a neural network.

Given the binary classification nature of this prediction problem, a textbook approach would be to use a Logistic Regression function. However, I believe it would be an injustice to overlook Neural Networks, especially given their ability to learn non-linear relationships.

Background: Having studied Neural Networks and Deep Learning in my postgraduate course, I completed this project as a bridge to applying these concepts in a real-world setting and to begin exploring quantitative finance. Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you have ideas for extending the work or any feedback!

_Side note: I purposefully chose to keep this network simple given the small dataset to avoid overtraining._

***The uploaded code will be adjusted and tidied soon with comments explaining the code and flow of work.***

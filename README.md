# Loan-Risk-Analysis
Forage - Quantitative Research - Loan Risk Analysis 

This repository is my solution to the third project of the Forage JPMorgan Quantitative Research Virtual Internship. This task looked at predicting loan defaults for a commercial bank, with a dataset of each customer's loan profile. Within the code, you can see that I've tried to enhance my feature set with ratios of the original features.

Given the binary classification of this prediction problem, a textbook answer would be to use a Logistic Regression function, however I think it would be an injustice to overlook Neural Networks given their ability to learn non-linear relationships.

(Side note: I have purposefully chosen to keep this network simple given the small dataset to avoid overtraining)
